## Introduction

*Since I was young, I have had a strong passion for the environment, particularly the ocean. As a frequent scuba diver living in a small beach town in Mexico, I have developed a deep connection with marine life and ocean ecosystems. With the emergence of AI and machine learning (ML) technologies, I became curious about how these innovations are being applied to environmental protection, specifically in monitoring ocean activities. This curiosity led me to discover OceanMind, a pioneering organization in this field. The following document provides an in-depth analysis of OceanMind and how they utilize AI to protect marine wildlife and combat illegal fishing activities.*

## Overview and Origin

OceanMind is a nonprofit organization founded by Nick Wise in 2014. Initially, the company spun out from the Harwell Satellite Applications Catapult at the Harwell Campus in the UK. OceanMind was created in response to the growing concern over illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, which accounts for up to a third of all fish caught globally each year. Tracking and mitigating this issue is essential for ensuring a sustainable future for the world's oceans. OceanMind leverages satellite data and artificial intelligence to monitor marine environments, initially focusing on illegal fishing but expanding its mission to include issues like labor violations on fishing vessels and the protection of underwater cultural heritage.

## Funding and Support

OceanMind operates as a nonprofit organization and is supported by partnerships and grants. One of its major supporters is Microsoft, through its AI for Earth program, which helped OceanMind transition to cloud-based real-time data processing. Their funding comes from collaborations with governments, NGOs, and international organizations that focus on ocean conservation.

## Business Activities

OceanMind's primary mission is to combat illegal fishing, which depletes fish populations, disrupts marine ecosystems, and contributes to human rights violations such as forced labor. Overfishing poses a threat to global food security, as approximately one-third of the world's fish stocks are overfished. OceanMind uses AI and satellite data to provide governments and enforcement agencies with real-time information to act swiftly against these activities.

OceanMind's core customers include governments, international organizations, NGOs, and seafood companies responsible for enforcing marine regulations and ensuring sustainable fishing practices. They also collaborate with retailers like Sainsbury's, helping to ensure sustainable sourcing for seafood products. The global seafood market is valued at over $120 billion annually, and OceanMind plays a crucial role in protecting the livelihood of over 3 billion people who rely on seafood as their primary protein source.

OceanMind stands out from competitors through its unique blend of AI-powered satellite data to monitor vast oceanic regions in real-time. Their technology can track and analyze vessel movements, detect illegal fishing behaviors, and even identify dark vessels that turn off their tracking devices. This system allows for targeted enforcement, making the process more efficient and cost-effective than many competitors. Additionally, OceanMind offers insights on labor violations and human rights issues aboard fishing vessels, a distinctive extension of their technology.

## Landscape

OceanMind operates in the AI-driven marine conservation field. This field has seen rapid advancements in satellite technologies and AI-based monitoring systems to enhance ocean conservation efforts.

Over the past 5–10 years, there has been a growing use of AI and machine learning to analyze large datasets, such as satellite imagery, to track illegal fishing activities. The integration of AI into conservation efforts has allowed for better decision-making and enforcement in real time.

Other organizations operating in the marine conservation and illegal fishing detection space include:

1. [Global Fishing Watch](https://globalfishingwatch.org/): A nonprofit organization that uses satellite data and AI to track fishing activities globally, focusing on creating transparency in global fishing activities.
2. [Sky Truth](https://skytruth.org/): An environmental nonprofit that uses satellite imagery to expose environmental issues, including illegal fishing.
3. [Sustainable Fisheries Partnership (SFP)](https://www.sustainablefish.org/): Focuses on monitoring fisheries to ensure sustainable practices, often collaborating with companies to improve sourcing practices.
4. [Seafood Watch (Monterey Bay Aquarium)](https://www.seafoodwatch.org/): Provides guidelines and tracks sustainable seafood practices while partnering with tech companies to monitor fishing activity.

## Results

OceanMind has made significant strides in combating illegal fishing, protecting marine biodiversity, and addressing human rights violations. Their system has proven successful in detecting illegal fishing operations, improving enforcement efficiency, and promoting sustainable seafood supply chains. Metrics used to measure their performance include the reduction in illegal fishing incidents, increases in fish biomass and biodiversity, and the sustainable sourcing of seafood.

In comparison to competitors like Global Fishing Watch, OceanMind offers targeted enforcement tools for governments, whereas other organizations often focus on transparency and public awareness. This unique approach gives OceanMind a strong competitive edge.

## Recommendations

My recommendation to OceanMind would be to further utilize their satellite images and AI-driven analysis to recommend new Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). By using their existing software to analyze high fishing demand zones, coral reef locations, fish density data, and other indicators of environmental performance, they could provide valuable insights on where protection should be expanded or new MPAs established. 

This strategy would allow OceanMind not only to stop illegal fishing activities but also to make data-backed recommendations about where fishing should be restricted. Collaborating with local marine experts to gather insights into which areas are most critical for fish biomass preservation would further enhance the accuracy and impact of their recommendations. Leveraging these local inputs, OceanMind could apply similar strategies to other regions by combining expert knowledge with geographical data.

This expansion would utilize their current AI, satellite imagery, and data processing capabilities, helping OceanMind play a more proactive role in marine conservation by contributing to MPA planning and optimization.
