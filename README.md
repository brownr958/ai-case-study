This repo contains Challenge 1 of the AI/ML Bootcamp. It is a case study focused on Ocean Mind, a leading AI company working to protect our oceans.

## Introduction

*Since I was young, I have had a strong passion for the environment, particularly the ocean. As a frequent scuba diver living in a small beach town in Mexico, I have developed a deep connection with marine life and ocean ecosystems. With the emergence of AI and machine learning (ML) technologies, I became curious about how these innovations are being applied to environmental protection, specifically in monitoring ocean activities. This curiosity led me to discover OceanMind, a pioneering organization in this field. The following document provides an in-depth analysis of OceanMind and how they utilize AI to protect marine wildlife and combat illegal fishing activities.*

## Overview of OceanMind

OceanMind is a nonprofit organization founded by Nick Wise in 2014. Initially, the company spun out from the Harwell Satellite Applications Catapult at the Harwell Campus in the UK. OceanMind was created in response to the growing concern over illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, 
>which accounts for up to a third of all fish caught globally each year.

Tracking and mitigating this issue is essential for ensuring a sustainable future for the world's oceans. OceanMind leverages satellite data and artificial intelligence to monitor marine environments, initially focusing on illegal fishing but expanding its mission to include issues like labor violations on fishing vessels and the protection of underwater cultural heritage.

## Funding and Support

OceanMind operates as a nonprofit organization and is supported by partnerships and grants. One of its major supporters is Microsoft, through its AI for Earth program, which helped OceanMind transition to cloud-based real-time data processing. Their funding comes from collaborations with governments, NGOs, and international organizations that focus on ocean conservation.

## Problem Being Solved

OceanMind's primary mission is to combat illegal fishing, which depletes fish populations, disrupts marine ecosystems, and contributes to human rights violations such as forced labor. Overfishing poses a threat to global food security, as approximately one-third of the world's fish stocks are overfished. OceanMind uses AI and satellite data to provide governments and enforcement agencies with real-time information to act swiftly against these activities.

## Target Customers

OceanMind's core customers include governments, international organizations, NGOs, and seafood companies responsible for enforcing marine regulations and ensuring sustainable fishing practices. They also collaborate with retailers like Sainsbury's, helping to ensure sustainable sourcing for seafood products. The global seafood market is valued at over $120 billion annually, and OceanMind plays a crucial role in protecting the livelihood of over 3 billion people who rely on seafood as their primary protein source.

## Unique Advantages and Technology

OceanMind stands out from competitors through its unique blend of AI-powered satellite data to monitor vast oceanic regions in real-time. Their technology can track and analyze vessel movements, detect illegal fishing behaviors, and even 
>identify dark vessels that turn off their tracking devices. 

This system allows for targeted enforcement, making the process more efficient and cost-effective than many competitors. Additionally, OceanMind offers insights on labor violations and human rights issues aboard fishing vessels, a distinctive extension of their technology.

## Other Key Players in the Field

Other organizations operating in the marine conservation and illegal fishing detection space include:

1. [Global Fishing Watch](https://globalfishingwatch.org/): 
> A nonprofit organization that uses satellite data and AI to track fishing activities globally, focusing on creating transparency in global fishing activities.
    
2. [Sky Truth](<https://skytruth.org/>): 
> An environmental nonprofit that uses satellite imagery to expose environmental issues, including illegal fishing.
    
3. [Sustainable Fisheries Partnership (SFP)](<https://www.sustainablefish.org/>): 
>Focuses on monitoring fisheries to ensure sustainable practices, often collaborating with companies to improve sourcing practices.
    
 4. [Seafood Watch (Monterey Bay Aquarium)](https://www.seafoodwatch.org/): 
> Provides guidelines and tracks sustainable seafood practices while partnering with tech companies to monitor fishing activity.
    

##Impact and Performance

OceanMind has made significant strides in combating illegal fishing, protecting marine biodiversity, and addressing human rights violations. Their system has proven successful in detecting illegal fishing operations, improving enforcement efficiency, and promoting sustainable seafood supply chains. Metrics used to measure their performance include the reduction in illegal fishing incidents, increases in fish biomass and biodiversity, and the sustainable sourcing of seafood.
